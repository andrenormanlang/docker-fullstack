    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Usage 🚀

1. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2. Build the application:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

3. Start the application:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### File Structure 🗂️

- `components/CardComponent.tsx`: Card component for displaying user information.
- `pages/_app.tsx`: Custom App component to initialize pages.
- `pages/api/hello.ts`: Example API route.
- `pages/index.tsx`: Main page component where the user management functionality is implemented.
- `styles/globals.css`: Global styles.

## Backend Setup 🛠️

### Installation 📥

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Usage 🚀

1. Start the server:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

### File Structure 🗂️

- `index.js`: Main server file where Express server and routes are defined.
- `prisma/schema.prisma`: Prisma schema file for database modeling.

## Database Setup 🗄️

This application uses PostgreSQL as the database. The Prisma ORM is used for database interactions.

1. Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running.
2. Set up the database using Prisma:

    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

## Docker Setup 🐳

To run the application using Docker, ensure Docker is installed on your machine and follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located.
2. Build and start the containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

This will start the frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL database in separate containers.

## Environment Variables 🌐

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres?schema=public
```

Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory with the following content:

```env
